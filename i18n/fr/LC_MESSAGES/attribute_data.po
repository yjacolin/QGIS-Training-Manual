msgid "Up to now, none of the changes we have made to the map have been influenced by the objects that are being shown. In other words, all the farms look alike, and all the roads look alike. When looking at the map, the viewers don't know anything about the roads they are seeing; only that there is a road of a certain shape in a certain area."

msgid "But the whole strength of GIS is that all the objects that are visible on the map, also have attributes. Maps in a GIS aren't just pictures. They represent not only objects in locations, but also information about those objects."

If you know which attributes you need, you can quickly decide if you're able to use a given dataset, or if you need to look for another one that has the required attribute data."
